PROJECT TITLE: TRON
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: TO CREATE A TRON GAME OF 2-3 PLAYER FULLING FUNCTIOING WITH BUTTONS TO SUPPORT PLAYING AND INTERFACE
VERSION or DATE: 3.4
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: CLICKING THE PLAY BUTTON
AUTHORS:DAVID LIU
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Basically, How the game works is similar to light cycle in Tron, what you would wish to do is to not die from hiting yourself or the borders or the body of other player. You may not turn backward to hit your previous path, as then youll hit yourself.
 * The aim of this game is to not die and to beat the other player the best you can. This game will support only two and three player. The keys are shown in the controls screen or the info for this. It is strongly suggested you try to play more defensive as 
 * this is basically a "last man standing" game! Some of the features include the score counter, player selection, a pause button, music button, isntructions and control popup. Note that some keys will not work during game and certain times for better outlook. 
 * Head on head colision means no one gets a point and the game will end! Get Crashing!
 * NOTE: for more fair game, there is a one second delay before game start so that whoever clicks the play button has enough time to come back to keyboard and get ready!
 * NOTE: to replay after winner decided, hit the enter button can work too!
 * All picture and button credits go to me
 * 
 * Suggested features to try out: All buttons that can be pressed, head on head collision, 3 player mode for sure, sound and mute!
 * Font for info and control screen is got at dafont.com, the font name is called Tron
 * Music: thank you to Daft Punk, no copyright intended, all rights are still reserved to the producer to this music. This was the original sountrack to "Tron: Legacy" the movie, which inspired me to do this game! Downloaded at 320kps hi quality at Itunes.
